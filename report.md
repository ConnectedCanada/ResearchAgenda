## A Note from the Co-Chairs

One year ago, we brought together academics, policymakers, and technologists around the common goal of mobilizing research into what it means to be a digital citizen in Canada and how we, as researchers and activists, can overcome the gaps in data limiting our understandings.

We hosted the Connected Canada conference at the University of Ottawa on October 13<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup>, 2017. We wanted to help facilitate a network of people interested in better understanding Canadians' uses of the Internet and related digital tools. We aimed to collaboratively establish a research agenda. 

Like many of you, over the past year, we have reflected on the insights advanced during the two-day conference and continued discussions through meetings and collaboration. In this report, we review the procedures we used to guide discussions at the conference and present a working research agenda for understanding Canadian citizenship in a digital media environment. We would like to note that in this report we use the terms "citizen" and "citizenship" in a sociological sense which emphasizes social actors within their communities, rather than from a legal perspective.

Our vision for this conference came from concern about a lack of data about Canadians' Internet use, preferences and comfort levels. We learned that the concern was misplaced. Some data exists but is siloed and inaccessible to most researchers because of institutional and communication barriers. Despite this lack of consistent data, our motivated and active governments at all levels, civil society groups and private sector actors are working to develop new tools and practices. Along with researchers at universities and think tanks across the country, pockets of robust civil society and government departments have dedicated themselves to help solve problems and develop strong policies which are responsive to the needs of Canadians and Canada.

Yet, it remained overdue for our community to come together to reflect and ask questions like: What research and what methods of inquiry have been the most successful at creating positive change? What do we need to know about Canadians to encourage the use of new digital tools which range from social media to digital government services? What aspects of digital life are we forgetting about in our work? How can we, as academics, policy makers, or members of civil society work _together_ to create stronger digital policies in Canada?  

With these questions as a springboard, participants at Connected Canada dove deep into what we know and what we don't know about Canadian Internet use, comfort and needs. Throughout Connected Canada, we heard many suggestions for expanding research in this area, which we present in this report. 

It is important, however, to remember who we did not hear from at the conference. Our application process was designed to encourage a diversity of representation from individuals across Canada working in a variety of organizations, positions, and levels of seniority. We sought to help alleviate barriers to attending by offering funding for travel-related expenses. Despite our efforts to engage a diversity of voices, our meeting lacked significant input from indigenous peoples, visible minorities, and people from Ontario were over represented. As a result, we recognize that these findings are limited and do not capture the full breadth of possible perspectives. We look forward to further opportunities to connect with diverse groups as we continue to collaborate on this project with you. 

This knowledge synthesis report presents the perspectives of participants in order to facilitate discussion and collaboration, but it is only the first step.

Feel free to share and respond to this document widely. In the spirit of collaboration, and learning from the civic tech community, this report is also available and open for comments on GitHub.

## Experts Meeting: Data Availability and Needs in Canada

We convened a group of experts to discuss the institutional barriers to sharing data about how Canadians use the Internet to engage in their communities and communities and enable their citizenship. This conversation highlighted two interesting developments: first, that data previously shared about Canadians was now siloed in separate research communities and, secondly, a need for internationally comparable data. 

Many of our experts noted that, at different times in Canada's history, sharing information from and with institutions like Statistics Canada was easier. One of the most troubling things we heard was that the sense of collegiality among researchers working in this field had declined. As a group, we discussed the importance of simply picking up the phone and reaching out to other groups who might benefit from the using the same datasets in their analyses. This echoed calls for interdisciplinary research and private-public partnerships, as one of the main challenges that we have is accessing the data that exists in a way that is helpful.  

Incorporating private-public partnerships is a possible response to overcoming that challenge. Although well resourced, there was hesitation among experts around privileging private-public research partnerships. Our experts largely discussed dissatisfaction with how easily Internet intermediaries can restrict or limit access to their data. Instead, suggestions trended towards emphasizing government's role in ensuring data is accessible. The difference in data quality standards between private sector and academic data collection may pose a barrier to collaboration, and requires an understanding of best practices for moving forward.    

Our experts (unsurprisingly) agreed that the accessibility of data on digital citizenship turns on its comparability. Suggestions for how to streamline data include modelling any further projects on existing studies of online preferences. For instance, the American National Election Survey Model, which includes an adjudication process for survey questions, was noted for its collaborative and robust approach. Experts from Statistics Canada indicated that the return of the Canadian Internet Use Survey could be very helpful. 

Ultimately, finding the right funding model to support these efforts is critical. Experts suggested that positioning data collection and analysis efforts outside of academia would be helpful because it should not be tied to the academic granting system. We need consistency that short and medium term grants cannot currently support. An important first step identified by experts towards this end is creating a list of organizations working on digital citizenship to support better matchmaking when seeking specific data. 

Participants suggested looking at the Demos UK model for inspiration. It was suggested that early efforts be spent on this infrastructure. Reducing the cognitive overhead of collaborating with others will become a primary goal of our collective group, along with identifying impact and creating questions of social value.

**Our experts identified the following opportunities which require substantial institutional support:**
*   Create a system to inventory ongoing research and existing data on digital citizenship;
*   Create a list of organizations working on digital citizenship to support better matchmaking when seeking specific data;
*   Help communities promote research opportunities and datasets;
*   Follow up with Statistics Canada about the relaunch of the Canadian Internet Use Survey;
*   Encourage use of open data research in university curricula to get students engaged with open data;
*   Establish a university or think tank which can serve as the hub for promoting data accessibility.

## Opening Keynote: Citizenship in a Digital Government 

**Hillary Hartley**'s keynote address focused on the transformation that comes along with the increased use of digital platforms. Transforming government services entails transforming outdated services and the way this can be accomplished is transforming the culture of delivery. She focused on Ontario Digital Services' mandate to make government simpler, faster and better for people following user-centred and data driven methods.

Hillary Hartley shared with the audience best practices to manage transformations: 
1.  Leading by change, showing not telling; 
2.  Thinking like a designer and make things that people need and will use;
3.  Use metrics, analytics, and data to augment user research—measure everything, we're doing more than making websites but enabling the delivery of information; 
4.  Being agile—delivering early and often, building something small but learning in order to strive to be open by default in what they make, and how they work. 

Ultimately, culture change happens when we build trust in methodologies and reduce anxiety and fear by example that these methods deliver. We're not digital service but the change management facility. Chief Empathy Officer is what is needed to ensure we get optimal results.

## Breakout Sessions: Drafting a Research Agenda


### Methodology

Individuals were divided into four streams: Digital Rights, Government Service Design, News & Media, Civic Engagement. Each participant was assigned to a stream based on their indicated stream preference in the application form and the availability of space in the streams. 

There were facilitated morning and afternoon breakout sessions for each stream resulting in eight breakout sessions in total. 

During each breakout session the stream curators gave a presentation on the topic, followed by an expert panel. Next, participants were divided into smaller groups and a facilitator was assigned to each group. The smaller groups each developed specific questions which they responded to through a process the facilitator guided. Our facilitators used worksheets to help guide participants in their discussions and to take notes about the discussion. 

Immediately after each session, volunteers transcribed the notes taken by the facilitators and note takers online in a Google document. This was to ensure that details of the discussions were captured while they were fresh in the memory of the facilitators and to ensure accuracy of the data gathered and opportunity to verify and information which was unclear. These findings were then analyzed and prepared in the form of the present report.

This model provided participants with the opportunity to work together with experts in the field to create a unique and lasting output: a public research agenda for digital citizenship. 


### Digital Rights Stream

_Curated by Ellie Marshall, Dr. Florian Martin-Bariteau, and Dr. Jon Penney_

Participants discussed citizens' rights in the context of the digital society. They identified several challenges constant connectivity poses for citizens. The conversation focused on the role, responsibilities, and obligations of Internet intermediaries; though it remains unclear what shape it should or could take. There is also an apparent disconnect between end-user expectations and how data is actually used by platforms. These discussions included debate about who is best positioned to help citizens provide informed, voluntary, and accessible consent. Participants largely agreed that more research is necessary to better understand contemporary expectations around consent, and shape a coherent framework to protect digital citizens.


#### **Morning Session: Privacy, Identity and Freedom **

_Lead Discussants: Dr. Michael Geist, Marina Pavlovic, and Aneurin (Nye) Thomas_

##### Accessible Research 

Participants explored how we can translate research to civil society in a way that is sustainable. Special emphasis was placed on how we can foster a culture of collaboration—and sharing of methods and data—to establish sustainable research foundations. The discussion also emphasized the importance of building research prototypes and working with organizations to affect change at the platform level. 


##### Digital Surveillance

Participants discussed the development of best practices to engage platforms for research in digital surveillance. Participants emphasized that there needs to be greater responsibility and transparency on the part of platforms regarding information from which they benefit from. Some participants advanced that a centralized research body which would coordinate the relationship between private platforms and sharing of data is highly beneficial. Involvement from academics, lawyers, government actors are necessary to both ends.


##### Policy for Algorithmic Society  

In order to create policies which protect citizen rights in an algorithmic society, participants emphasized the necessity for policymakers to be able to access information about how digital tools work. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge regarding existing tools to enable these changes. Certainly, there is uncertainty regarding citizens' values with respect to privacy in a digital context. Successfully addressing these concerns involves creating a normative values system in addition to tools and strategies. To this end, it is important to collaboratively work to share best practices across jurisdictions while rendering current legislative tools regarding emerging technologies more accessible. 


##### Informed and Transparent Consent

The topic of informed, transparent consent that is regularly updated and easily accessible was also discussed. Participants identified the need for granular opt-out options in terms and conditions policies. There is presently a false choice between being able to refuse the terms and the need to use the platform. In order to address these emerging concerns, participants suggested bolstering public information regarding alternative choices, segregating data to ensure privacy, and introducing a third option in terms of conditions to provide alternatives to accept. Participants emphasized that a holistic strategy between government and civil society is a foundational resource required to support these endeavours in public education regarding informed consent.


#### **Afternoon Session: Citizens and their Data**

_Lead Discussants: David Fewer, Ellie Marshall, and Dr. Teresa Scassa_

##### Data Literacy and Data Access

Participants focused on how individuals can be provided with better information regarding their privacy on various platforms to increase the quality of consent. They argued it is necessary for individuals who participate in online platforms to have a solid foundation of principles of data, security and privacy, and how to navigate opt-in/opt-out features. Participants advocated for legally mandated transparency reports from the private sector with regard to users' data. In this sense, data should be treated as a public utility and therefore private companies dealing with data would act as information fiduciaries. Academics and researchers would need to work with the private sector and legal professionals in order to mobilize initiatives to this end. 


##### Documenting the Use and Application of Data 

Participants discussed the ambiguities in privacy legislation surrounding data collection standards and citizens' privacy rights. Participants suggested this gap can be addressed through the establishment of a digital charter as well as more robust legal protections and legislative frameworks. Participants identified the need for a central research body which will research and evaluate these laws in addition to the establishment of an independent legislative branch mandated to focus on emerging technology issues.


#### Digital Rights Research Agenda
*   Empower policymakers with the necessary tools and permission to create protections for civil rights in an algorithmic society.
*   Design and distribute resources that help citizens understand the life cycle of data.
*   Study methods for enforcing informed, transparent, and accessible consent practises.
*   Advocate for data sharing between researchers and Internet platforms, emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability in that process
*   Create strategies to ensure information revealed by governments is not selective.
*   Promote policies which shift burden onto Internet platforms to be accountable for how their services are used.
*   Study relationships of trust between Internet platforms and citizens.
*   Study power of local regulators to restrict harmful activities of Internet platforms.
*   Study which data needs to be collected to support commerce and trade, and which data should not be collected.


### Government Service Design Stream

_Curated by Kent Aitken, and Dr. Amanda Clark_

Participants discussed how to help governments identify risks in deploying new digital services and the importance of learning from our mistakes. "Holistic accessibility" was proposed as a model for ensuring that services meet not only the baseline regulatory requirements of accessibility, but also take into account citizens who do not have familiarity with technology at all. Participants in this stream also identified a need for creating benchmarks for governments across the country to meet. Measuring success in service design will become increasingly important, alongside creating strong partnerships across jurisdictions. 


#### **Morning Session: Bringing Government into the Digital Era **

_Lead Discussants: Dr. Amanda Clarke, Matthew Gray, and Gabe Sawhney_

##### Ensuring Access 

Participants accentuated the need for better understanding platforms and strategies to promote inclusivity. Participants recognized it is unfeasible to have all Canadians online, but still sought to find strategies to ensure those who wish to be online are able to access platforms without barriers. In the context of the discussion of the Phoenix pay system, participants argued that the government should avoid rushing decisions pertaining to the adoption of emerging technologies and should instead increase testing phases before implementing new technologies. Participants also discussed the need for governments to focus on creating a more user-friendly system with design that is accessible by default. To this end, those involved in creating digital policy and websites should come from a diversity of backgrounds to ensure services are created for a diversity of needs.

Ultimately, participants argued government should strive for continuous development including iterating and learning from small mistakes to avoid big ones. Simultaneously, they suggested there needs to be an acknowledgment that systems will always be a mix of analogue and digital. Participants also advocated for better methods of evaluating what is working or not for digital government services. In this vein, participants stressed the need to discuss successful initiatives so that others can be readily aware of best practices. 


##### Citizen Involvement in the Policy Process 

Participants highlighted the role of public servants in engaging citizens in the government's policy-making process. They focused on methods to create stronger coordination between levels of government and citizens, reorganizing government so it is responsive to citizens' needs, and increasing education regarding digital tools for government and the encouragement of public servants to undertake collaboration efforts. To support these orientations, there needs to be time for the public service to develop a culture shift. Onboarding and socialization practises of public servants should also be studied. In addition to increasing the frequency of the public service surveys, public servants should also be evaluated more often on their community engagement efforts. At the same time, exit interviews of public servants would help transfer corporate knowledge and best practices. 


##### Open by Design 

Participants also deliberated how to establish more open by design frameworks. Participants argued that there are not sufficient set boundaries to be open by design. Additionally, barriers exist to understanding how we can measure success of open by design initiatives. Furthermore, it is unclear how to leverage prosumers (consumers that contribute to the open environment) in these processes. Small failures, pilot projects and incremental implementation were all identified as methods to ensure that open by design is successful. Importantly participants highlighted the need for a cycle of engagement which would result in regular feedback for contributors. The cycle must start with openness and a sense of collaboration across team members. Next, consistent metrics to measure success and performance are essential to achieving success in open by design initiatives. Resources need to be directed to clarifying the definition of open, developing infrastructure for open by design and updating the role of public servants and other stakeholders implied in the process. More resources should be directed to the study of open by design in academia. 


#### **Afternoon Session: Building Empathy for the User**

_Lead Discussants: Kent Aitken, Matthew Gray, and Meghan Hellstern_

Participants discussed on working with the general public to create and design digital services. Currently, there is a problem in understanding how digital services are designed in collaboration with the public. There needs to be better communication from inside to outside government. Digital services should enhance current processes with explicit consideration of digital literacy levels among the population while also being mindful of accessibility of the digital tools. Participants emphasized that co-design strategies are essential to help foster cultural change in government and to allow citizens to give feedback to the government, all while revisiting assumptions about what services should look like.


#### Government Service Design Research Agenda
*   Create resources to help government choose between digital and analogue service delivery, in recognition of limits of digital connectivity.
*   Study how silos between institutions hinder digital government service delivery.
*   Study the economic, social and political costs of government digitization.
*   Promote design practices which centre and support accessibility needs.
*   Strengthen coordination between levels of government to help citizens collaborate directly on policies.
*   Study the feasibility of an "open by design" framework for all digital government services in Canada.
*   Empower the general public to create and design digital services.


### News and Media Literacy Stream

_Curated by Celeste Côté and Dr. Alfred Hermida_

Participants discussed the ways in which citizens access, understand, and share information about current affairs and their political system. Participants emphasized institutional problems facing media delivery in Canada, including funding of news outlets. This conversation highlighted a concern that there is a sense of disconnection between Canadian readers and news content. This could potentially be addressed through more empathetic and connected storytelling, increased diversity in newsrooms and more partnerships between local news organizations and community events. Participants suggested that legacy media outlets tend to be more risk-averse and discussed new strategies for empowering marginalized voices, such as investigating the role of influencers in the media cycle. Many participants also expressed concern over misinformation with an interest in creating a culture that guards against over-regulation in order to future-proof Canadian news media against government interference.  


#### Morning Session: Smart News Citizens

_Lead Discussants: George Abraham, Dr. Collette Brin, and Jane Lytvynenko_


##### Media Fatigue?

Participants highlighted difficulties for citizens in navigating through the media noise to find content which resonates with them and responds to their needs. Participants proposed responses from the news industry which included: Leveraging empathy and developing sense of trust to communicate credible factual information and engage people. 

Participants suggested people currently feel a sense of disconnection and do not meaningfully identify with what they are seeing. In this context—where publication is not enough—how can we amplify news? 

Some worried a shortage of critical thinkers and the tendency towards confirmation bias could breed polarization and extremist tendencies. But exhaustive research in the Canadian context is not yet available. 

There is a lack of trust in institutions and media fatigue: people are faced with unclear options for affecting positive outcomes. Successfully navigating these challenges requires publishers to better connect with audiences through empathetic storytelling, partnerships and in person events to compliment digital initiatives. This should be driven by public institutions such as the CBC and universities who need to experiment and be given the authority to fail.


##### Marginalization of Voices in a Digital Age and Citizen Empowerment and the Media

Participants discussed the marginalization of voices in the digital age. Currently there is a lack of diversity of voices facilitating the broader conversations in mainstream media. To increase the diversity in the voices that create stories in the mainstream, increasing financial resources to grassroot publications and bridging communities via gatekeepers is essential.

Participants underscored the role of media organizations in empowering citizens to assess the media in an uncertain information environment. Many challenges in the current media structures were discussed. For example, the lack of inclusivity marked by underrepresentation of certain communities resulting in distrust and disengagement with the media. The unwillingness of Canadians to pay for online news was also a significant challenge. The perceived assumption by the media and academia that people cannot make the best decisions for themselves was problematized. As well, social class and level of education were identified as major contributions to media literacy cleavages. Increased volume and speed of information renders it more difficult to filter information resulting in the use of shortcuts to assess quality of information. As a result there are inadequate tools to support individuals as they evaluate the quality of information they consume.

With these considerations in mind, participants advocated for further elaboration between news literacy skills and media literacy. They also advocated for initiatives which encourage the reflection of people's analytic processes for decision-making. To this end, participants advocated the movement away from labels that simplify media and media habits into good/bad or literate/illiterate. At the same time, they sought an increase in environments that welcomes new forms of quality media.


#### **Afternoon Session: Cultivating a Healthy Media Ecosystem**

_Lead Discussants: Mike De Souza, Pari Johnston, Erin Millar, and Jessica Murphy_

Participants identified strategies to raise capital to support new media startups, noting that Canadian startups do not have the same access to financial resources as their American counterparts. This is a result, participants suggested, of Canadians' unwillingness to pay for news. Furthermore, there is no umbrella organization to advance the interests of non-legacy media.

In order to overcome some of these challenges, there is a need for additional resources advocating for small media groups in addition to content which is driven to engage the user meaningfully. Participants suggested using intellectual property as collateral to help media startups raise capital. They also suggested that an expansion of the Canada Media Fund, the antitrust laws and a new lobbying group for small organizations could help. Additionally, membership models would help build connection with communities and foster greater engagement as opposed to subscription models. More audience-oriented analysis and content would help foster relationships.

Interestingly, the challenge in engaging folks in civic spaces seems similar to those of engaging them with the media, and certainly the debates regarding representation are akin.


#### News and Media Literacy Research Agenda
*   Promote and support solution-oriented journalism about how Canadians can take action on issues they care about
*   Strengthen partnerships between national and local media
*   Study how to establish trusted news and media curators in the online world 
*   Support diverse voices in storytelling
*   Establish distinction between news literacy and media literacy while creating an environment that welcomes new forms of quality media
*   Study Canadian news consumption patterns and willingness to pay for news content
*   Study novel uses of intellectual property rights to support emerging media outlets
*   Create a database of case studies and examples in order to communicate and test successes and failures


### Civic Engagement Stream

_Curated by Megan Beretta and Dr. Elizabeth Dubois_

Participants discussed the importance of institutional bridge building and creating strong methods for measuring engagement. Participants expressed concern about how the Internet can enable "slacktivism," and suggested an expanded media diet and improved educational resources as important to creating effective change. 

Together with Elections Canada, participants also discussed how to improve the election experience for citizens. In particular, participants suggested researching how Elections Canada can leverage digital tools and influencers (individuals on social media who have large followings) to create more in-person engagement around electoral issues as well as ensure transparency in the elections process. 


#### **Morning Session: Defining and Measuring Acts of Citizenship**

_Lead Discussants: Dr. Thierry Giasson, Catherine MacDonald, and Caitlin Myles_


##### Who is Engaging?

Participants ultimately deliberated on how we can foster more civic engagement through digital tools. Discussions also centred around issues of access to these tools and how they can support offline initiatives. There was a significant focus on understanding who is engaging online, and how different people use a variety of digital tools for different ends. Participants argued that while data exists about users, there is no systematic organization of the data, so it is unclear what types of data are available or where they are stored. At the same time, participants noted that if online engagement does drive policy change, it will reflect only those who are engaged on the specific tool which inspired the change. As such, feedback we receive online is potentially is not encompassing of the diversity of perspectives. Participants expressed that if policy change is driven by online engagement, it needs to account for missing voices and actively seek avenues to incorporate those voices prior to implementing changes.


##### Access as a Right

Some people who would like to have Internet access cannot get online. To this end participants called on the government to move towards seeing access to the Internet as a right. To support these efforts, participants suggested the coordination of policies and collaboration between government, academia, civil society and citizens. Participants pointed to a need for a central organizing body that can support and coordinate efforts towards inclusive programing which bolsters engagement and provides access to the Internet. 


##### Digital Tools

Participants discussed strategies to increase digital civic engagement tools. The definitions of "engagement" and "digital tools" were discussed and it was noted that the precise definition of each may change as technology advances. Participants were curious about how to create a greater capacity to evaluate tools to measure different types of advocacy. There was also significant interest in understanding how digital tools are employed by a diversity of users. For example, participants questioned how governments may use these tools differently from citizens and how digital tools can be used to engage citizens in governance.


##### Slacktivism, an Outdated Term

Participants highlighted how we can foster meaningful civic engagement online. Participants agreed that the term "slacktivist" was outdated and instead focused on strategies that can be adopted to transform civic engagement online to meaningful engagement offline. In a similar vein, they found the measure of voter turnout to be limiting and called for more robust indicators of civic engagement. Participants argued that well-rounded civic participation requires the education system to undertake training initiatives related to diverse media diet and the use of an array of digital tools for students.

The topic of slacktivism also raised a host of questions regarding engagement opportunities. Some suggest youth may see online activities as the only route for engagement. If this is true, is the problem then a lack of opportunities for engagement? This led to further questions such as: How do we distinguish between slacktivism and activism? How do we convert enthusiasm of online activity to offline? What if individuals only want to demonstrate they care, but do not actually want to undertake more? How do we increase the desire to be politically engaged? Understanding the perspectives of disengaged or under-represented groups as we try to respond to these questions is crucial.


#### **Afternoon Session: From Everyday Citizenship to Electoral Participation**

_Lead Discussants: John Beebe, Mark Blevis, Mark Coffin, and Tara Mahoney_

The afternoon session was hosted in conjunction with Elections Canada. The session centred around best practices to engage citizens and organizations that serve priority groups in a digital media environment. Participants discussed strategies to help citizens combine digital and analogue tools in order to inspire electoral engagement.

There is a lack of data on the voting habits of specific groups. As a result, we do not have a strong understanding of who is disengaged. Since tailored civic engagement strategies for specific demographics are the most successful, it is important to better understand which specific groups are disengaged. But more resources are required to build a capacity to maintain continued engagement with these marginalized groups.

There was also a common sentiment regarding the need to understand the changing culture surrounding voting and civic engagement behaviours in elections. A focus of this afternoon session was identifying strategies to move from consultation to co-design and collaboration on engagement initiatives. This involves encouraging participation by engaging individuals on topics they care about and highlighting the relevance of politics to their activities.  

Participants also identifies key ways to help increase engagement included:
*   Using art media as a tool for engagement with policy debates;
*   Sharing content that already exists as opposed to making new content;
*   Creating a culture of engagement by fostering genuine relationships with audiences;
*   Ensuring positive words and messaging and avoiding negative words which will deter people's involvement with political affairs;
*   Building influence by engaging in a targeted way with niche demographics.

Finally, the session explored how people can leverage digital tools to enhance face to face engagement. To this end—and with the recognition that political engagement is increasingly informal—suggested strategies included recognizing the potency of online networks.


#### Citizen Engagement Research Agenda
*   Use existing knowledge about who is excluded from digital technologies towards concrete actions to connect all Canadians.
*   Promote and lobby for the right to communicate to be enshrined in Canadian law and policy.
*   Study "slacktivism" in order to expand the media diet and opportunities of users of digital tools.
*   Create a culture of engagement around all Canadian elections.
*   Study how influencers shape election outreach to develop best practices.
*   Examine the role of technology companies in collecting and sharing data about elections.
